- First, sorry for my bad English.
- Second, I know there are lots of topics about this. But after solving a problem that need FastIO, I feel interested in FastIO and decide to do the implementations and comparing them. But it maybe time-consuming so I make this post for ones who maybe try to find the Effeciency-Simple-IO, so you can save time instead of searching more.
- Third, usually it is need not to use FastIO. In the contest, they usually have twice or more time of the solutions code than the given time limitation. Dont worry about faster IO if it is not needed, you should improve your algorithms first, maybe you can use Bitwise Operations for x8 x32 x64 faster.
- Fourth, if the problem need to be solve in O(n) ~ O(n log n), and your algorithms work in O(n ^ 2), this Micro-Optimization doesnt help you at all (maybe you will get some more points but hard get AC), you should change the algorithms for further approach.
- Final, for some problems that needed to be solved by FastIO, you can use the suitable template and modify it for your solving the problem. Dont use the template if you dont really know how to use (I may add a guide path to the post in the future)
- Conclusion, this post is about comparing the implementations for each version of C++ language and you should choose the most suitable for you.
